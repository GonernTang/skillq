"""Container-side wiring — Step 5 (2026-06-26) refactor.

Replaces :mod:`skillq.runtime.container_wiring`
(886 lines, 6 bind-mounts, 5 path env vars, 2 host→container
embed host:port env vars). The new version is ~250 lines, 2
bind-mounts, 0 path env vars (host owns everything via
``/rank``), 0 host→container embed host:port env vars (one
endpoint, ``SKILLQ_RANK_ENDPOINT``, replaces the legacy pair).

**What changed in Step 5 (vs the legacy container wiring)**:

- **bind-mounts from 6 → 2**: only the hook script + skills
  tree. ``lib.json`` / ``q_table.json`` / ``emb_cache.json``
  are gone — the host owns those in ``MethodServices`` and
  exposes them via ``/rank``. ``settings.json`` is now
  generated on the container's first call (Step 5 falls back
  to a host-generated ``settings.json`` bind mount for
  compatibility, but the host-side can also write
  ``settings.json`` once and bind-mount it as a second
  mount — for now we keep it as a 3rd mount to minimise
  disruption; Step 6's host-side self-healing closes this).
- **No more ``_write_state_files``**: the trial staging dir
  used to host 4 JSON files (lib.json + q_table.json +
  emb_cache.json + calls_log.jsonl). Now we just write the
  per-trial ``method_state.json`` (already done by
  :func:`skillq.runtime.steps.step_save_state`) and the
  host's ``MethodServices`` carries the live snapshot.
- **No more legacy ``start_container_wiring``**: we now use
  :func:`skillq.services.ranking_service.start_ranking_service_background`
  (Step 3) which exposes ``/rank`` + ``/embed`` (back-compat) +
  ``/healthz``. The ranking daemon's ``app.state`` carries
  ``lib`` + ``mgr`` + ``emb_cache`` + ``method``; the bridge's
  ``on_trial_started`` calls
  :func:`skillq.services.ranking_service.inject_ranking_state`
  to refresh it at each trial boundary.
- **No more 5 path env vars**: ``SKILLQ_LIB`` /
  ``SKILLQ_Q_TABLE`` / ``SKILLQ_EMB_CACHE`` / ``SKILLQ_CALLS_LOG``
  / ``SKILLQ_USER_TASK`` are dropped. The hook only needs
  ``SKILLQ_RANK_ENDPOINT`` + the 9 ``SKILLQ_HOOK_*`` /
  ``SKILLQ_SIM_GATE_*`` tunables (single source: the host
  bridge's :func:`skillq.runtime.env_seed.seed_agent_env`).
- **calls log path drops to 1 mount**: the hook writes to
  ``/logs/agent/sessions/skillq_skill_calls.jsonl`` inside the
  container, and Harbor's auto-injected ``agent_dir`` mount
  (``<trial_dir>/agent`` → ``/logs/agent``) makes the file
  visible on the host at the same path with no extra mount.
  Same as the legacy — preserved verbatim.

**ContainerWiringHandle** is now a thin wrapper around the
ranking service's handle (Step 3's
:class:`RankingServiceHandle`) plus the ``MethodServices``
reference (Step 4). Same name as the legacy dataclass so
Step 6's import-replacement doesn't churn the call sites.

    2026-07-01 (Bug #51/#52 fix): the returned file's
    ``"skillq"`` block now carries:

    - ``user_task`` — the agent's task intent (2000-char cap)
    - ``calls_log_path`` — the per-trial path the hook writes to,
      inside the bind-mounted ``<trial_dir>/agent/sessions/_calls_log/``

    on every request (with module-level cache). This replaces the
    previous env-var transport (SKILLQ_USER_TASK /
    SKILLQ_CALLS_LOG_PATH) which raced against Harbor's per-trial
    ``agent._extra_env`` snapshot under
