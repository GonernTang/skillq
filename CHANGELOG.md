# Changelog

All notable changes to `skillq` (the branch-style entrypoint that re-uses
the upstream `skills_vote` lifecycle AND runs the SkillQ paper's
four-layer method on top of Harbor) are documented here.

> **2026-06-25 — Strict Hard Gate: `sim_gate_floor` default 1 → 0**
>
> The Hard Gate (`sim_gate_min_score=0.7`) drops candidates whose
> raw cosine similarity to the sub-task intent is below threshold.
> The accompanying `sim_gate_floor` parameter was the **minimum
> number of candidates to keep** when the gate would otherwise
> leave the list empty. Its old default of 1 was a footgun:
>
> - The agent's PreToolUse hook received a "best of a bad lot"
>   top-k of irrelevant skills (scored by UCB-only), which
>   polluted its context ("maybe try one of these?").
> - Those same skills got their `n_retrievals` counter incremented
>   in the Q-table, polluting Q-value evolution.
>
> New default: `sim_gate_floor=0` (strict mode). When every
> candidate is below the 0.7 sim gate, the hook returns an
> **empty top-k** and emits an explicit "no relevant skills"
> message — the agent is expected to solve the sub-task
> directly without invoking Skill(). Q-table `n_retrievals`
> does NOT increment for any skill in that trial.
>
> Opt back into the legacy behavior by setting
> `sim_gate_floor: 1` (or higher) in `method-config`. The
> pre-fix fall-through is replaced with a stricter "keep
> top-N by raw sim" path: if the gate leaves fewer than
> `sim_gate_floor` survivors, we keep exactly the top-N
> (not the entire pre-gate list).
>
> Implementation:
> - `MethodConfig.sim_gate_floor` default 1 → 0
>   (`skillq/skillq_runtime/config.py`).
> - `SKILLQ_SIM_GATE_FLOOR` env var default `"1"` → `"0"`
>   (`hook.py:147`).
> - `_score_skills` gate branch rewritten to enforce
>   `len(kept) == sim_gate_floor` instead of falling through
>   to the full pre-gate list.
> - `_format_top_k` and `_format_pull_context` explicit
>   "No skills in the library are relevant" message when
>   `top_k` is empty (replaces the confusing "Top-0 ... Re-call
>   Skill with one of these" wording).
> - `_cosine` tolerates numpy arrays (`not a` raised ValueError
>   on `np.ndarray`).
>
> Smoke verification (chess-best-move, 1-task): with strict
> mode, the hook returned `top_k=[]` and `chess-image-to-move`
> Q went 0.5 → 0.6174 (positive update; agent got reward=1
> without being distracted by an irrelevant top-k). 232/232
> tests pass (10 new in `tests/test_hard_gate_strict.py`).
>> **2026-06-25 — `MethodConfig.reuse_q_table` + `reuse_embedding_cache`
> + opt-in state co-location**
>
> Two independent bool flags (both default `True`) let users force
> fresh-start semantics for the Q-table and emb_cache separately:
>
> ```yaml
> reuse_q_table: false            # drop Q values; re-seed with seed_initial_q
> reuse_embedding_cache: false    # drop emb_cache; re-embed every skill
> ```
>
> Typical use cases:
> - Switch `embedder_model` (dim mismatch) → set `reuse_embedding_cache: false`
> - Ablation requires Q-table-free start → set `reuse_q_table: false`
> - Reproduce a paper figure from scratch → set both
>
> **State co-location is opt-in.** `resolved_state_path()` keeps the
> legacy `<library_root>/.state/` default. To co-locate method state
> with `seed_skills_dir` (so version control covers both curated
> skills and learned Q-table), set:
>
> ```yaml
> state_path: <seed_skills_dir>/.skillq_state/method_state.json
> ```
>
> `.gitignore` adds `skills/.skillq_state/` so the state files don't
> pollute commit history. New YAML example:
> `experiments/configs/method_tb2_skillq_fresh_start.yaml`.
>
> Implementation:
> - `MethodConfig.resolved_emb_cache_path()` mirrors `resolved_state_path()`.
> - `QlibState.load_into(overwrite_q=...)` lets the bridge load
>   library + probation bookkeeping without touching the Q-table.
> - `VectorTable.clear()` empties the cache and marks `_dirty=True`.
>
> Tests: 11 new (5 unit + 6 integration), 214/214 total pass.

> **2026-06-25 — Rename `paper_mode/` → `skillq_runtime/`**: The
> sub-package that bridges the four-layer `skillq.method/` algorithm
> onto the Harbor harness was renamed for clarity. `paper_mode` was
> confused with the "SkillsVote baseline" (a separate sub-package at
> `skillq/skillsvote_mode/`) and with the upstream `lqrl` paper code;
> `skillq_runtime/` makes the "this is SkillQ's own runtime layer"
> intent explicit and parallels `skillsvote_mode/` cleanly.
>
> - Directory: `skillq/paper_mode/` → `skillq/skillq_runtime/`
> - All `import_path: skillq.paper_mode.agent:SkillQClaudeCodeAgent`
>   strings in `experiments/configs/*.yaml` and
>   `experiments/smoke/*.yaml` updated.
> - All Python imports in `skillq/`, `tests/`, `experiments/run/`,
>   `experiments/smoke/debug_smoke.py` updated.
> - README, RUNNING.md updated. Historical CHANGELOG entries
>   preserved (they document the name at the time).
> - CLI subcommand `skillq paper …` is **unchanged** — only the
>   module path moved. Future PR may rename the subcommand itself
>   (`paper` → `run`) for consistency; tracked separately.
> - 203/203 unit + integration tests pass after the rename.

> **2026-06-16 — Decouple from upstream `lqrl`**: The repository was
> previously a sibling of `/home/gonern/workspace/lqrl` and depended
> on it as an editable Python dependency (`skills_vote`) plus a
> sibling-repo source for `prebuild_images.py` and benchmark input
> data. After this change:
>
> - `lqrl/src/skills_vote/` is **vendored in-tree** at
>   `./skillsvote/` (572KB; 30 Python files). `pyproject.toml`
>   points `skills_vote` at `./skillsvote` instead of `../lqrl`.
> - `prebuild_images.py` is vendored at `./skillsvote/prebuild_images.py`.
>   The `skillq prebuild` wrapper CLI no longer reaches into a sibling
>   repo (`--lqrl-root` flag renamed to `--skillsvote-root`,
>   default `./skillsvote`).
> - The benchmark input data path is now configurable via
>   `MethodConfig.benchmark_input_path` (or `$SkillQ_INPUT` env var,
>   or `./input` fallback) instead of the hard-coded
>   `/home/gonern/workspace/lqrl/input/terminal-bench`.
> - `PaperClaudeCodeAgent` (which inherited from the upstream
>   `SkillsVoteClaudeCode`) is replaced by `SkillQClaudeCodeAgent`,
>   a direct subclass of `harbor.agents.installed.claude_code.ClaudeCode`
>   with no upstream base class. The legacy `PaperClaudeCodeAgent`
>   name is kept as an alias for backwards compatibility.
> - The `--mode lqrl` argparse choice in experiment runners was
>   renamed to `--mode skillsvote` to match the CLI subcommand
>   (`skillq skillsvote`).
>
> Result: `uv sync` resolves everything from `./skillsvote/` and
> the project no longer depends on any sibling-repo source path.

> **2026-06-16 — Project rename**: The repo was renamed from
> `mg` → `skillq` and the project rename cascaded through:
> - Python package: `paper/` → `skillq/` (`paper_mode` and
>   `skillsvote_mode` sub-packages kept their names as logical
>   sub-modes; class names like `PaperClaudeCodeAgent` and
>   `MethodConfig` are unchanged).
> - CLI entry point: `paper` → `skillq`
>   (`uv run paper paper run …` is now `uv run skillq paper run …`).
> - Env-var prefix: `MG_*` → `SKILLQ_*`.
> - Path prefixes: `.mg_library/`, `mg_state/`, `mg_skills/`,
>   `mg_skill_hook.py`, `mg_skill_calls.jsonl`,
>   `mg_extract_<hash>/`, `mg_lib.json`, `mg_q_table.json`,
>   `mg_emb_cache.json` → `skillq_*`.
> - The user's paper was also renamed (LQRL → SkillQ); references
>   to the upstream `lqrl` package (sibling at `../lqrl`,
>   `LQRL_ROOT` env var, `implementation_guide/lqrl/...` skeleton
>   citations) are **preserved** because they point at an
>   external dependency.

This first entry covers everything built during the initial
implementation: the two-mode dispatch, the paper four-layer
implementation, the create_skill path, the experiment scaffolding,
and the developer ergonomics (`.env`, `prebuild`, `RUNNING.md`).

## [Unreleased] — 2026-06-08

### Added

#### Top-level package

- `pyproject.toml` — PEP 621 metadata, `uv`-managed deps. Pulls
  `skills_vote` (the upstream `lqrl` distribution) from
  `../lqrl` via `[tool.uv.sources]` because the package is not
  on PyPI. Pulls `harbor==0.5.0`, `litellm`, `pydantic`,
  `omegaconf`, `claude-agent-sdk`, `python-dotenv`,
  `tomlkit`. Dev group has `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio`.
- `README.md` — high-level overview; describes the two
  mutually exclusive run modes and the shared `.env` workflow.
- `.env.example` — same shape as lqrl's `.env.example`
  (`OPENAI_*` / `ANTHROPIC_*` / `CODEX_*` keys) so users can
  `cp lqrl/.env paper/.env` and reuse the same secrets.
- `mg/__init__.py` — re-exports `lqrl_main` and `paper_main`.
- `mg/cli.py` — top-level `paper` console-script with three
  subcommands: `lqrl`, `paper`, `prebuild`. Each builds its own
  `argparse` tree lazily.
- `mg/env.py` — `load_env_file(...)` dotenv loader. Same
  semantics as lqrl's `skills_vote.harbor.cli.load_env_file`:
  `override=True`, silent when the default `.env` is missing.

#### `paper/method/` — paper four layers + extract

- `types.py` — `Skill` / `Qlib` / `Verdict` / `RetrievalResult`
  core data types. Skill carries the body, retrieval/usage
  counters, and metadata; Qlib is a bounded dict-backed library
  (Eq. 2 invariant `|M_t| ≤ B_max`).
- `hash.py` — `qhash(text) → int` (sha1[:16] → int). Used as
  the Q-table's intent key.
- `retrieval.py` — `TwoStageRanker` (Phase A cosine + Phase B
  Eq. 4 re-rank with z-scored similarity, z-scored Q, and
  UCB bonus). `StubEmbedder` for tests; `LiteLLMEmbedder` for
  production.
- `layered_q.py` — `BetaLayeredQ` (Eq. 6 update) with
  `increment_clip` safety guard. Plus three theoretical
  helpers (Theorems 1, 2, 3 of the paper).
- `library.py` — `LibManager` (Sec. 3.3 admission / eviction
  / rejuvenation). Hard `B_t ≤ B_max` constraint enforced in
  `maintain()`. Default hyperparameters intentionally differ
  from the paper defaults (`n_explore=8`, `theta_admit=0.25`,
  `theta_evict=0.15`, `n_stale=80`) to make mg's defaults not
  a verbatim copy.
- `near_miss.py` — `NearMissRefiner` (Sec. 3.4 / Layer 4).
  Triggers on `r_task == 0 ∧ Q ≥ θ_nm`, edits the skill in
  the 20% token cap.
- `verifier.py` — `IndependentVerifier` (Sec. 3.2). Uses
  `LiteLLMVerifierBackend` (independent session, temperature
  0). `StubVerifierBackend` for tests. 4-axis 0-1 scoring
  schema (`old_score`, `new_score`, `improved`, `rationale`).
- `editor_backend.py` — `LiteLLMEditBackend` (separate
  class for clarity; same call shape as verifier).
- `state.py` — `QlibState` JSON serialiser. Path
  `<library_root>/.state/method_state.json`. Skips collision
  with lqrl's `skills_vote_evolve_state.json`.
- `prompts.py` — four prompts in own wording (deliberately
  different from lqrl's 55 KB of inline prompts):
  - `VERIFIER_PROMPT` — 4-axis 0-1 scoring with `r_learning`
    clamping; explicit information-isolation preamble.
  - `EDIT_PROMPT` — 20% token cap, "skill name unchanged / no
    new tools / full text not diff" constraints.
  - `ATTRIBUTION_PROMPT` — 6-class verdict enum
    (`success_skill_used` / `success_viewed_skill_but_not_used`
    / `success_no_skill_seen` / `fail_*`) plus
    `knowledge_to_extract` blob.
  - `EXTRACT_SKILL_PROMPT` — materializes a new `SKILL.md`
    under a sandbox via `claude --print`.
  - `RETRIEVAL_PROMPT` — Eq. 4 audit-only explanation.
  - `EXPLAIN_R_LEARNING_PROMPT` — verifier rationale helper.
- `attribution.py` — `AttributionAnalyzer` runs the
  attribution LLM call. Mirrors lqrl's `step_feedback`
  shape: reads session jsonl + available-skills list,
  produces a 6-class verdict.
- `extractor.py` — `SkillExtractor` spawns a
  `claude --print --permission-mode=bypassPermissions`
  subprocess that physically writes a `SKILL.md` under
  `<sandbox>/create/<name>/`. Mirrors lqrl's
  `evolve/claude_code.py` shape.

#### `mg/lqrl_mode/` — pass-through to upstream lqrl

- `cli.py` / `entrypoint.py` / `config.py` — pure
  pass-through. `paper lqrl run -c X` forwards to
  `skills_vote.harbor.cli.main(argv)`. ~100 lines total,
  zero implementation logic.

#### `paper/paper_mode/` — paper-mode orchestration

- `config.py` — `MethodConfig` Pydantic model with ~20 fields
  covering all paper hyperparameters + LLM model names +
  persistence paths + `enable_auto_extract` /
  `extract_max_new_per_trial` / `extractor_claude_cli`.
- `bridge.py` — `attach_paper_registers(job, method)`
  wires a single `on_trial_ended` hook that runs the
  full pipeline:
    1. `AttributionAnalyzer.analyze(...)` (1 LLM call)
    2. TwoStageRanker `retrieve_for_intent(...)` (Eq. 4)
    3. IndependentVerifier (Sec. 3.2 information-isolated)
    4. β-layered Q-update on each retrieved skill
    5. (NEW) auto-extract trigger on success
    6. `LibManager.maintain(...)` (admission / eviction / stale)
    7. `QlibState.save(...)` (persistence)
    8. (failures only) `NearMissRefiner.propose_edit(...)`
  Wrapped in `try/except Exception: logger.exception(...)` so
  a method bug never aborts the trial.
- `agent.py` — `PaperClaudeCodeAgent(SkillsVoteClaudeCode)`.
  Calls `rerank_with_ucb(...)` to append a "[mg UCB re-rank
  breakdown]" block to the instruction, then delegates to
  `super().run()` (lqrl's recommend step + claude exec).
- `retrieval_step.py` — `rerank_with_ucb(...)` agent-side
  helper. Reads `agent.skills_dir` (the directory lqrl's
  recommend step copied skills into) and re-ranks with
  `TwoStageRanker`.
- `cli.py` / `entrypoint.py` — `paper paper run -c X
  --method-config Y`. Loads `.env`, then dispatches to
  `bridge.run_paper_job_sync`.

#### `paper/prebuild_cli.py` — Docker image prebuilder

- `paper prebuild run --benchmark {tb2|tb_pro|swebenchpro}
  --agent {claude_code|codex}` is a thin wrapper around
  lqrl's `scripts/prebuild_images.py`. The `paper` command
  looks up the right `scripts/configs/prebuild_images*.yaml`
  based on the (benchmark, agent) pair and runs the
  underlying lqrl prebuild via `subprocess.run`. Optional
  `--cfg-path`, `--image-tag`, `--max-workers`, `--lqrl-root`,
  `--download-only`.

#### `integration/skills/skillq-method/`

- `SKILL.md` — Claude-Code-style skill description for the
  paper-mode lifecycle. Reads only this file first, runs
  `route_prompt.py`.
- `scripts/route_prompt.py` — standalone agent-callable
  script that runs `TwoStageRanker` on the mounted
  skills root. Default embedder is `StubEmbedder` (no API
  key needed); `--embedder live` switches to
  `LiteLLMEmbedder`.

#### `experiments/`

- `run_benchmark.py` — single driver for TB 2.0 / TB Pro /
  SWE-Bench Pro. Takes `--mode {lqrl|paper}` and writes
  a job-config YAML to `experiments/configs/<bench>_<mode>.yaml`,
  then dispatches to `paper <mode> run -c <yaml>`. Supports
  `--dry-run`, `--n-concurrent`, `--n-attempts`,
  `--task-subset`, `--agent-model`, `--agent-import-path`.
- `ablation.py` — 6-cell ablation (with/without UCB,
  verifier, near-miss).
- `beta_sweep.py` — 7-cell β sweep (0.0–1.0).
- `kappa_sweep.py` — inter-rater κ audit with 3 verifier
  backends.
- `run_terminalbench.py` — older stub kept for reference.
- `configs/tb2_skillq.yaml` / `tb_pro_skillq.yaml` /
  `swebenchpro_skillq.yaml` — three ready-to-run paper-mode
  templates.
- `configs/tb_pro_lqrl.yaml` — auto-generated lqrl-mode
  template.
- `RUNNING.md` — 8-section operator guide: prerequisites,
  prebuild, three invocation modes, three benchmark
  recipes, output structure, multi-seed / sweep / ablation
  commands, troubleshooting, and the new §8 on
  `enable_auto_extract`.

#### `tests/` — 45 unit tests, all passing

- `test_skillq_method_layers.py` — 14 skillq-method unit
  tests (the same 14 from `implementation_guide/lqrl/tests/
  test_core.py`, ported with renamed classes).
- `test_paper_hooks.py` — QlibState round-trip, bridge
  hook mock with stub LLM backends, retry-failure skip.
- `test_lqrl_mode_attach.py` — passthrough dispatch
  verification.
- `test_env_loading.py` — 4 dotenv loader tests.
- `test_attribution.py` — stub backend, prose-wrapped JSON
  fallback, session jsonl loader.
- `test_extractor.py` — happy path, body under/over cap,
  name length check, subprocess fail / timeout / missing
  CLI.
- `test_bridge_extract.py` — 5 integration tests for the
  extract trigger conditions and Q-bump side effect.

### Notes

- All LLM calls go through `litellm`. No `claude-agent-sdk`
  or `codex` subprocess in the paper-mode code path except
  the optional `extractor_claude_cli` (which is opt-in
  via `MethodConfig.enable_auto_extract`).
- The paper method's create_skill path follows the
  design from the conversation about Q1/Q2/Q3 but those
  *final* Q-value-on-Skill / mixed-factor-eviction
  refactors are **deferred to a follow-up commit**. The
  current code still uses the LibManager-owned Q-table
  with single-skill-level Q via `qhash`. The interface
  for the refactor is documented in `RUNNING.md` §8.
- 45 / 45 tests pass under `uv run pytest tests/`.
